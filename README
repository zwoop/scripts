box[.pl]
--------

This little script was inspired by the old Late Night hacking at LiTH in
the 80's. It's useless, but cute. For example, use it like


    $ fortue | box



pkg-du[.sh]
-----------

This script, which supports .deb (e.g. Ubuntu) and RPM (e.g. Fedora Core)
systems, will examine all installed packages, and do a "du" on each
package. The output is not sorted (yet), but can easily be done in a
pipe. For example, use it like

    $ pkg-du | sort -nr -k2

vboxhl[.sh]
-----------

Start (and kill) VirtualBox headless instances, from a little interactive
dialog menu. usage:

       boxhl: Start / stop headless VirtualBox instances

       Options:
		-s | --start	Select a VM to start
		-k | --kill	Select a VM to kill
